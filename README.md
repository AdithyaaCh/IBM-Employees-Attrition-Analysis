# IBM-Employees-Attrition-Analysis

This project explores why employees leave an organization and how we can predict and reduce attrition using data. The dataset used is the classic IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset, commonly found on Kaggle.

I looked at this not just as a machine learning problem, but as a **business problem**. What factors are pushing employees to leave? What can be done about it? And whatâ€™s the cost of ignoring it?

## What I Did-

- Explored employee behavior, compensation, experience, job satisfaction, and more
- Found clear patterns in attrition based on role, income, age, job involvement, and workload
- Created visual dashboards to uncover trends and support HR decisions
- Built machine learning models to predict who is likely to leave next

## Key Business Insights

- High attrition risk in lower job levels, single employees, and early-career workers
- Salary hikes, stock options, and job involvement significantly reduce attrition
- Overtime is a major red flag â€” highly correlated with quitting
- R&D employees tend to stay longer than marketing or sales roles

---

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Tableau for interactive dashboards
- Jupyter/Kaggle notebooks
